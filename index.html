            <h3>Understanding the Condition</h3>
            <p>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is often associated with children, but it can persist into adulthood. Many adults with ADHD may not realize they have it, as the symptoms can manifest differently than in children. Recognizing these signs is the first step toward better mental health.</p>
